    "# ***Understanding and Preparing Data***\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I developed a comprehensive web-scraping and text-preparation pipeline designed to collect, clean, and structure content from the University of Chicago’s Master of Science in Applied Data Science (MSADS) program pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow combines an automated crawler to dynamically discover all relevant subpages, main-text extraction using trafilatura for high-quality content retrieval, and intelligent chunking to prepare data for embedding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that only meaningful program-related information  is captured, cleaned, and split into context-preserving text segments for downstream analysis."

I also joined the DUNE Collaboration, where my main interest is CP violation in the neutrino sector.\\nPreviously I worked for about a decade on the CMS experiments, with major contributions to the Higgs boson discovery, SUSY searches and Standard Model measurements.\\nI served as CMS Track Reconstruction convener in 2013-2014.\\nKyle Chard is a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory. He has been Program Director of the Data & Computing Summer Lab since its first iteration under CDAC in 2019, and previously oversaw the Summer Internship Program ran by the former Computation Institute.\\nHe received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Victoria University of Wellington in 2011. He co-leads the Globus Labs research group which focuses on a broad range of research problems in data-intensive computing and research data management. He currently leads projects related to parallel programming in Python, scientific reproducibility, and elastic and cost-aware use of cloud infrastructure.\\nI direct the Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Laboratory (CASNL) in the Department of Psychology. Research in my lab investigates the neural and computational mechanisms underlying how emotions affect how people see, remember, and interact with others. We take a multimodal approach that combines brain imaging with behavioral experiments, physiological measures, computational models, and machine learning methods.\\nRecently, we have also started using AI models as artificial model organisms of the human and brain, similar to how animal models serve as model organisms for biology. In this line of work, we have AI models and humans perform the same tasks, while assessing the alignment in representations and behavior. As the models are fully controllable, we can systematically intervene on their inputs or architecture to generate testable predictions about human behavior and brain function.\\nTo learn more about Dr. Leong\\u2019s work, check out the CASNL Website and his appearance on the Mind Matters Podcast.\\nYuxin Chen is an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech, hosted by Prof. Yisong Yue. He received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Prof. Andreas Krause. He is a recipient of the PIMCO Postdoctoral Fellowship in Computing and Mathematical Sciences, a Swiss National Science Foundation Early Postdoc.Mobility fellowship, and a Google European Doctoral Fellowship in Interactive Machine Learning.\\nHis research interest lies broadly in probabilistic reasoning and machine learning. He is currently working on developing interactive machine learning systems that involve active learning, sequential decision making, interpretable models and machine teaching.

The thesis will be an extension of students’ previously completed Capstone Project. 2-year program students are highly encouraged to complete a research Capstone (as compared to a traditional, industry Capstone) for various reasons.\\nThe longer degree timeline offers more time to engage in academic and professional development while maintaining the same rigorous core curriculum and access to UChicago’s faculty and data science network. The first 12 of 18 courses that students complete in the 2-year program follow exactly the same course progression as those in the 1-year, 12-course program.\\nThe 2-year program is not currently available to those in the Online program and/or those pursuing the MS in Applied Data Science on a part-time basis.\\n-\\nWhen can I apply for the 2-year thesis track program?\\nThe application portal for the 2-year full-time option will open in September 2025. Applicants apply through the same portal as the standard MS in Applied Data Science program. The deadline to be considered for this track is December 4, 2025. There are a limited number of spots available in this new 2-year thesis track (18 courses) program. Those who are not admitted to the 2-year program will be automatically considered for the 1-year 12 course program unless they choose to opt-out of consideration.\\n-\\nMay I switch between the 1- and 2-year programs after officially enrolling in the MS-ADS program?\\nNo. Once admitted to the 1-year program, there is no opportunity to enroll in the 2-year program. Those admitted to the 2-year program might, under extenuating case by case circumstances, graduate early after completing the initial 12 courses of the MS degree (4-5 quarters). Any such student must meet with program faculty and staff by the required deadlines in order to maintain good academic standing and/or visa compliance (if applicable).\\n-\\nIf I am admitted to the In-Person, Full-Time 1-year program, may I take any of the 2-year program electives?\\nNo, due to the limited number of spots available for the new 2-year program, the electives are reserved for only those students admitted to the 2-year program specifically. Should anything change, students will be notified.\\n-\\nWhat is the 2-year program's thesis requirement?\\nThose admitted to the full-time, in-person thesis track pathway (18 courses, 6 quarters of coursework) are required to complete and submit a written thesis. The thesis will be an individually authored text based on an area of interest from students’ Research Capstone Project. The thesis will be managed through the required thesis courses (2, 100 units each). A lead faculty member with knowledge of the student’s area of interest will supervise the thesis project and provide resources and support as needed.\\nAs an alternative to a traditional written thesis, students may opt to complete a thesis project that results in a ‘minimum viable product’ project. Through this option, students will complete a rigorous, multi-step ‘build’ and ‘marketing’ phase throughout the required 2 thesis courses. The thesis project will also be supervised by a program faculty member.\\n-\\nHow many spots are available in the new 2-year program?\\nWhile subject to change, there are a projected ~50-55 spots available for the 2-year program. For application year 2025-26 (for entrance in autumn 2026), applicants must apply by the round two application deadline (December 4, 2025) in order to be considered for the 2-year program. Students admitted to the 2-year program will take the same 12 courses as those in the 1-year program, but they will complete 6 more courses over 2 additional quarters in their 2nd year of study for a total of 18 courses.\\n-\\nWhat is the new 2-year thesis track program (18 courses), and how is it different from the 1-year program (12 courses)?</td>\n",

It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\\n-\\nStatistical Models for Data Science\\nIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\\n-\\nMachine Learning I\\nThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\\n-\\nAdvanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\\nSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\\n-\\nApplied Generative AI: Agents and Multimodal Intelligence\\nThis course explores Advanced Generative AI with a focus on multimodal modeling, a transformative AI paradigm integrating diverse data types—text, images, audio, video, time-series, and point clouds.

It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\\n-\\nGenerative AI: Principles and Applications\\nThis course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models.

The methods that belong to this class include liner programming, quadratic programming and mixed-integer programming. Second class of methods has been developed to optimize a simulation model. The difference with the classical mathematical programming methods is that the objective function (which is the function to be minimized or maximized) is not known explicitly and is defined by the simulation model (computer code). The course will demonstrate multiple approaches to build simulation models, such as discrete event simulations and agent-based simulations. Then, it will show how stochastic optimization and heuristic approaches can be used to analyze the simulated system and design a sequence of computational experiments that allow to develop a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system through exploration of the parameter space, to find robust plausible behaviors and conditions and robust near-optimal solutions that are not prone to being unstable under small perturbations.\\n-\\nQuantitative Finance: Methods and Applications\\nThis course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement.\\n-\\nReal Time Intelligent Systems\\nDeveloping end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based.

Proof of English proficiency may be waived under certain criteria noted by UChicago GRAD Admissions.\\n-\\nWhat are the main differences in programs and outcomes between the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science compared to Computer Science?\\nThe fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The MPCS program focuses on the center of Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of multiple fields, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). The outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. The outcomes for students in MS-ADS include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect.\\n-\\nHow do I apply to the MBA/MS joint degree program?\\n-\\n2-Year Thesis Track Program\\n-\\nWhat is the new 2-year thesis track program (18 courses), and how is it different from the 1-year program (12 courses)?\\nBeginning in academic 2026-27, a limited number of In-Person, Full-Time students will have the opportunity to complete a 2-year version of the MS in Applied Data Science program. The 2-year program is completed over 21 months (2 academic years). Students in the 2-year program will complete 18 instead of 12 courses. The additional 6 courses consist of 4 additional elective courses (100 units each); and 2 required thesis courses (100 units each) that culminate in the completion of a required written thesis or thesis project. The thesis will be an extension of students’ previously completed Capstone Project. 2-year program students are highly encouraged to complete a research Capstone (as compared to a traditional, industry Capstone) for various reasons.\\nThe longer degree timeline offers more time to engage in academic and professional development while maintaining the same rigorous core curriculum and access to UChicago’s faculty and data science network. The first 12 of 18 courses that students complete in the 2-year program follow exactly the same course progression as those in the 1-year, 12-course program.\\nThe 2-year program is not currently available to those in the Online program and/or those pursuing the MS in Applied Data Science on a part-time basis.\\n-\\nWhen can I apply for the 2-year thesis track program?\\nThe application portal for the 2-year full-time option will open in September 2025. Applicants apply through the same portal as the standard MS in Applied Data Science program. The deadline to be considered for this track is December 4, 2025. There are a limited number of spots available in this new 2-year thesis track (18 courses) program. Those who are not admitted to the 2-year program will be automatically considered for the 1-year 12 course program unless they choose to opt-out of consideration.\\n-\\nMay I switch between the 1- and 2-year programs after officially enrolling in the MS-ADS program?\\nNo. Once admitted to the 1-year program, there is no opportunity to enroll in the 2-year program. Those admitted to the 2-year program might, under extenuating case by case circumstances, graduate early after completing the initial 12 courses of the MS degree (4-5 quarters). Any such student must meet with program faculty and staff by the required deadlines in order to maintain good academic standing and/or visa compliance (if applicable).\\n-\\nIf I am admitted to the In-Person, Full-Time 1-year program, may I take any of the 2-year program electives?\\nNo, due to the limited number of spots available for the new 2-year program, the electives are reserved for only those students admitted to the 2-year program specifically. Should anything change, students will be notified.\\n-\\nWhat is the 2-year program's thesis requirement?\\nThose admitted to the full-time, in-person thesis track pathway (18 courses, 6 quarters of coursework) are required to complete and submit a written thesis. The thesis will be an individually authored text based on an area of interest from students’ Research Capstone Project. The thesis will be managed through the required thesis courses (2, 100 units each). A lead faculty member with knowledge of the student’s area of interest will supervise the thesis project and provide resources and support as needed.\\nAs an alternative to a traditional written thesis, students may opt to complete a thesis project that results in a ‘minimum viable product’ project. Through this option, students will complete a rigorous, multi-step ‘build’ and ‘marketing’ phase throughout the required 2 thesis courses. The thesis project will also be supervised by a program faculty member.\\n-\\nHow many spots are available in the new 2-year program?\\nWhile subject to change, there are a projected ~50-55 spots available for the 2-year program. For application year 2025-26 (for entrance in autumn 2026), applicants must apply by the round two application deadline (December 4, 2025) in order to be considered for the 2-year program. Students admitted to the 2-year program will take the same 12 courses as those in the 1-year program, but they will complete 6 more courses over 2 additional quarters in their 2nd year of study for a total of 18 courses.\\n-\\nWhat is the new 2-year thesis track program (18 courses), and how is it different from the 1-year program (12 courses)?   \n",

Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\\n-\\nAdvanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\\nSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\\n-\\nApplied Generative AI: Agents and Multimodal Intelligence\\nThis course explores Advanced Generative AI with a focus on multimodal modeling, a transformative AI paradigm integrating diverse data types—text, images, audio, video, time-series, and point clouds.

Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding. - Optimization and Simulation Methods for Data Science This course introduces students to how optimization and simulation techniques can be used to solve many real-life problems. It will cover two classes of optimization methods. First class has been developed to optimize real, non- simulated systems or to find the optimal solution of a mathematical model. The methods that belong to this class include liner programming, quadratic programming and mixed-integer programming. Second class of methods has been developed to optimize a simulation model. The difference with the classical mathematical programming methods is that the objective function (which is the function to be minimized or maximized) is not known explicitly and is defined by the simulation model (computer code). The course will demonstrate multiple approaches to build simulation models, such as discrete event simulations and agent-based simulations. Then, it will show how stochastic optimization and heuristic approaches can be used to analyze the simulated system and design a sequence of computational experiments that allow to develop a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system through exploration of the parameter space, to find robust plausible behaviors and conditions and robust near-optimal solutions that are not prone to being unstable under small perturbations. - Quantitative Finance: Methods and Applications This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It will cover two classes of optimization methods. First class has been developed to optimize real, non- simulated systems or to find the optimal solution of a mathematical model. The methods that belong to this class include liner programming, quadratic programming and mixed-integer programming. Second class of methods has been developed to optimize a simulation model. The difference with the classical mathematical programming methods is that the objective function (which is the function to be minimized or maximized) is not known explicitly and is defined by the simulation model (computer code). The course will demonstrate multiple approaches to build simulation models, such as discrete event simulations and agent-based simulations. Then, it will show how stochastic optimization and heuristic approaches can be used to analyze the simulated system and design a sequence of computational experiments that allow to develop a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system through exploration of the parameter space, to find robust plausible behaviors and conditions and robust near-optimal solutions that are not prone to being unstable under small perturbations. - Quantitative Finance: Methods and Applications This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

As they hire Data Scientist, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts from the University of Chicago the expectations for technical competence, communication and influence skills, and exposure to advanced Data Science evolving technologies is high. The skills learned in the program translate directly into practice due to the program’s balance between theory and rigorous application experience developed in coursework and the Capstone project work delivered across the curriculum. - Is the Master's in Applied Data Science Online program equally academically rigorous as the In-Person program? Yes. The Online Program curriculum is overseen by the same faculty curriculum committee as the In-Person program. Both programs are jointly reviewed and are held to the same high standards. Additionally, both programs are granted by the University of Chicago Physical Sciences Division. - Will my diploma indicate I completed the Master's in Applied Data Science Program Online? No, your diploma will not include ‘Online’ in the name of your degree. - If I am a student in the In-Person Master's in Applied Data Science Program, may I take courses in the Online Program? Conversely, if I am a student in the Online Program, may I take courses in the In-Person program? - MBA/MS - How do I apply to the MBA/MS joint degree program? Applicants interested in the Joint MBA/MS degree will apply through Booth’s centralized, joint-application process. Applicants should complete the Chicago Booth Full-Time MBA application and select the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science as their program of interest. An MBA/MS program supplement will be available for completion within your Booth application. The supplement contains Applied Data Science specific questions that will be reviewed by the Applied Data Science admissions team along with your full Booth application. For complete consideration, applicants should complete the MBA application and the joint degree program supplement in the same application round prior to submitting the application. - What courses will I take in the MBA/MS program? As a student in the joint-degree MBA and Applied Data Science program, you’ll take the equivalent of 23 100-unit courses: - 14 MBA classes - 9 data science courses - Leadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD) - Qualified Work Experience, a noncredit professional internship experience Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students will earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA. - Will MBA/MS courses be in-person or online? Your Booth courses will be in person, while your</td>\n",

Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students will earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA. A combination of online and in-person courses gives you flexibility in course scheduling, and you’ll earn two degrees in the time it would take to complete the MBA alone. - Are standardized tests required for admission? As part of the online application, candidates will be required to submit a GMAT or GRE score for the joint program. International applicants may be required to submit proof of English language proficiency by submitting a TOEFL iBT or IELTS test score. The minimum TOEFL iBT score required for admission is 104; the minimum IELTS score required is 7. Proof of English proficiency may be waived under certain criteria noted by UChicago GRAD Admissions. - What are the main differences in programs and outcomes between the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science compared to Computer Science? The fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The MPCS program focuses on the center of Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of multiple fields, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). The outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. The outcomes for students in MS-ADS include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect. - How do I apply to the MBA/MS joint degree program? - 2-Year Thesis Track Program - What is the new 2-year thesis track program (18 courses), and how is it different from the 1-year program (12 courses)? Beginning in academic 2026-27, a limited number of In-Person, Full-Time students will have the opportunity to complete a 2-year version of the MS in Applied Data Science program. The 2-year program is completed over 21 months (2 academic years). Students in the 2-year program will complete 18 instead of 12 courses. The additional 6 courses consist of 4 additional elective courses (100 units each); and 2 required thesis courses (100 units each) that culminate in the completion of a required written thesis or thesis project. The thesis will be an extension of</td>\n",

      "[Source 2]: Science by successfully completing 12 courses (6 core, 4 elective, 2 Capstone) and our tailored Career Seminar*. Our rigorous curriculum is designed by and for data science innovators and leaders. Courses are reviewed annually to ensure the content keeps pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of data science. You have the option to pursue the Master’s in Applied Data Science degree on a part- or full-time schedule. Part-time students enroll in two courses each quarter and take their courses in the evenings or on Saturdays. Full-time students take three courses per quarter. Some of their courses may be offered during the day. Foundational Courses (noncredit, optional) Foundational noncredit courses are designed and taught by Master’s in Applied Data Science faculty and instructors. These optional courses—available at no additional cost— provide the basis for the rigorous Applied Data Science degree. Course content undergirds the theoretical, strategic, and practical data science studies you will encounter in the rest of the curriculum. Beginning in academic year 2024-25, all entering students will complete a required online Foundational Skills Assessment. This required assessment helps faculty and advisors understand how to best support you once you begin in the program. You may choose to opt-out of taking the Foundational Skill Assessments and instead register for all four Foundational courses. The four Foundational noncredit courses are listed below.
