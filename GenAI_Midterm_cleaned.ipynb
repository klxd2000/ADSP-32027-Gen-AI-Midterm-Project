I investigated multiple diagnostics programs to determine how they function to help evaluate model performance. However, Testing these diagnostic tools supported my initial hypothesis that these programs didn\\u2019t offer easy access to the fundamental diagnostics of a model I was looking for. So I built a diagnostic package that cuts out extraneous features, and with those, the need for external resources or a deep knowledge of coding to provide new and inexperienced users with the fundamental diagnostics they need.\\nMentor: Jai Yu\\nProject Title: Behavior Modeling in Rats\\nMentors: Dylan Halpern & Julia Koschinsky\\nProject Title: In-Browser Spatial Analytics: Observable Notebook + WebGeoda Scaffolding\\nProject Description: This summer, I contributed to the creation of in-browser spatial analytics tools, which improve shareability and flexibility of geospatial research.

These changes have made it impossible to rely on the previous strategy of using supply and demand to make decisions. Our research looks at 2021 spot market prices and comparing them to 2018 and compare findings to results found in Deconstructing the 2017 Changes to AWS Spot Market.\\nMentors: Giuseppe B. Cerati & Jeremy Hewes & Daniel Grzenda\\nProject Title: Exa.TrkX: Improving Graph Neural Network Performance for Classifying Neutrino Interactions in MicroBooNE Data\\nProject Description: The Exa.TrkX project presents a graph neural network (GNN) technique for low-level reconstruction of neutrino interactions in a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). We discovered that the GNN model trained on DUNE simulation data performs quite poorly on the data from another neutrino detection experiment (MicroBooNE). After my colleague Kaushal modified the model architecture that allowed to detach the physical meaning from neutrino interaction graph edges, I explored new edge-forming techniques (such as Delaunay triangulation, KNN-graph, and radius graph) and retrained the model on MicroBooNE data, which resulted in 80% classification accuracy for physically meaningful interactions.\\nMentor: Junchen Jiang\\nProject Title: Quality of Experience Personalization Project\\nMentors: Jean-Baptiste Reynier & Anna Woodard, Olopade Lab\\nProject Title: Self-Supervised Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction\\nMentor: Chenhao Tan\\nProject Title: Using AI to Improve Radiology Residence Process\\nMentor: Nicholas Marchio\\nProject Title: Interactively Mapping Urban Human Development\\nProject Description: We studied the deployment of encrypted DNS outside of the mainstream resolvers by measuring DNS query response times and ping times for resolvers located across the world.

He co-leads the Globus Labs research group which focuses on a broad range of research problems in data-intensive computing and research data management. He currently leads projects related to parallel programming in Python, scientific reproducibility, and elastic and cost-aware use of cloud infrastructure.\\nI direct the Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Laboratory (CASNL) in the Department of Psychology. Research in my lab investigates the neural and computational mechanisms underlying how emotions affect how people see, remember, and interact with others. We take a multimodal approach that combines brain imaging with behavioral experiments, physiological measures, computational models, and machine learning methods.\\nRecently, we have also started using AI models as artificial model organisms of the human and brain, similar to how animal models serve as model organisms for biology. In this line of work, we have AI models and humans perform the same tasks, while assessing the alignment in representations and behavior. As the models are fully controllable, we can systematically intervene on their inputs or architecture to generate testable predictions about human behavior and brain function.\\nTo learn more about Dr. Leong\\u2019s work, check out the CASNL Website and his appearance on the Mind Matters Podcast.\\nYuxin Chen is an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

She is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and member of the Committees on Computational Neuroscience and Neurobiology and the Institute for Mind and Biology. Her research explores how we pay attention and how insights from attention research can help improve focus. Dr. Rosenberg completed her PhD and postdoctoral work in the Department of Psychology at Yale University after earning her undergraduate degree in cognitive neuroscience at Brown University.\\nA primary focus of Dr. Rosenberg\\u2019s work has been what we can learn about a person from their unique patterns of brain activity and what this can tell us about the nature of the brain and mind. In particular, she builds models that predict attention and cognition from functional neuroimaging data. This work has revealed, for example, that data collected while a person is simply resting in an MRI scanner (and not completing any task at all) can be used to predict aspects of their behavior, including how well they pay attention and remember information. Dr. Rosenberg\\u2019s work also uses behavioral, neuroimaging, and machine learning techniques to investigate how attention fluctuates over time, changes across development, and interacts with the rest of the mind.\\nI am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Yale University in 2020.

Interested in learning more about Summer Lab? Join us for a virtual information session on December 10 at 5:00pm CT. Register here. The Data Science Institute Summer Lab program is an immersive 8-week paid summer research program at the University of Chicago. In the program, undergraduate students (and Chicago-area high school students) are paired with data science mentors in various domains, including: computer science, data science, social science, climate and energy policy, public policy, materials science, and biomedical research.
